Throttle gamepad -- framereate issues

gameboardrect.left not working as desired for starting brick positions

ad padleft outer bounds

Ball doesn't always reset properly below pad

translate/transform for pad movement and possibly ball,to improve performance/frame rate

Use opacity instead of remove ?



TODO:
LEFT brick collision doesn't work properly, possibly right too 

Added a static ball state to moveball() , may/may not want to seperate it
